<h2> How do we do it? </h2>

<h2> First, we should know about the baseball's rules.</h2>
<uL>
    <li>In the rules, there are 3 outs in baseball and if you get
    3 strikes, you are out.</li>
    <LI> Also, batters have home runs, hits, doubles, and triples.</LI>
    <LI> Finally, if the ball is cross the ballpark line, it is a foul.</LI>    
</uL>


<h2> What do we need?</h2>
<p>Maybe, the kind of gloves and balles and bat, also we should need water.The most important thing is endless peple, because baseball need lots of people.
<h3> If we do lots of practice, we can become a good baseball player.</h3>
