    <h1>Baseball </h1>
    
<h2> How do we do it? </h2>

<h2> First, we should know about the baseball's rules.</h2>
<p>In the rules, there are 3 outs in baseball and if you get 3 strikes, you are out. Also, batters have home runs, hits, doubles, and triples. Finally, if the ball is cross the ballpark line, it is a foul.</p>
<h2> What do we need?</h2>
<p> Maybe, the kind of gloves and balles and bat, also we should need water. The most important thing is endless peple, because baseball need lots of people.</p>
<h2> If we do lots of practice, we can become a good baseball player.</h2>
